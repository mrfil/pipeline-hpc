# BIC 3T MRI HPC Pipeline Documentation
This is the documentation for the 3T MRI processing pipeline produced by creators at the Beckman Institute Imaging Center (BIC). The documenation is hosted on ReadtheDocs and you can view this documentation at [https://pipeline-hpc.readthedocs.io](https://pipeline-hpc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ "BIC 3T Pipeline documentation")

## Viewing documentation offline
If there is ever an unexpected quirk of the universe that brings down ReadtheDocs, you can always read the documentation by looking in the `./build/html/` folder found here. Open the file called `index.html` in your favorite web brower to get started.

## Contributing to the documentation
If you would like to help improve the pipeline documentation, below are a few helpful tips to get started.

The documenation relies primarly on the [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/) documentation generator for Python. The documents you see in the build folder were generated under Python 3.10.5. A requirements.txt file for pip has been included for ease of dependency installation.

Additionally, this documentation imports boilerplate text generated by individual modules used in this pipeline. This is to allow users to create custom documentation of the specific pipeline configuration used in their analysis which can be copied and pasted into methdods write-ups.

Because this supporting documentation is generated in TeX, some preprocessing needs to happen to convert the documents into a form that Sphinx knows how to handle. This is done with [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org) and more information about how to incorporate module-generated boilerplate files will be provided as this section of the documentation develops.
